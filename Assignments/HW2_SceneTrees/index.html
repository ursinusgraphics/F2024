										<h2><a name = "overview">Overview</a></h2>
										<p>
										The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize students with the JSON-based scene file format we will be using in the ray tracing assignment.  In particular, students will be making a variety of scenes to test their knowledge of scene trees and of 4x4 transformation matrices.  The assignment will culminate in the first art contest of our class, in which students design their own scenes out of the basic building blocks that exist in the engine.
										</p>
										
										<h3>Getting Started</h3>
										<p>
										You will be writing a series of JSON scene files in this assignment.  It is possible to everything (except for possibly the art contest) by writing and uploading your scene files to <a href = "../../../Modules/assets/js/ggslac/viewers/SceneViewer.html">the scene viewer</a> from the course web site.  You can also use the live <a href = "../../../Modules/assets/js/ggslac/viewers/SceneEditor.html">the scene editor</a> to play around with things in a more interactive manner before creating your final submissions.  However, for the art contest, you should open the <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie/ggslac">ggslac repository</a> in VisualStudio Code and launch the viewer, as described below:
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Clone or download the <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie/ggslac/archive/master.zip">ggslac repository</a>, which contains an engine that Dr. Tralie made for this class, and which you will be using to render and interact with scene files.
                                                </p>
                                            </li>

                                            <li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Navigate to the <code>viewers/SceneViewer.html</code> file.  This will launch the interface from which you can load your scene files.
                                                </p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
										
										
										<h2><a name = "submission">Submission Instructions</a></h2>
										
										You will submit all of your scene files and <a href = "#dino.js">dino.js</a> to Canvas when you are finished.  Please also submit a <b><code>README.txt</code></b> file with both submissions with the following information each time:

                                            The scene files are written in JSON syntax, and they specify a tree structure.  Each node in the tree has the following three fields
                                            <ol>
                                                <li><b><u>transform:</u></b>

                                                        Every node in the scene tree has a 4x4 transform matrix associated to it, which describes where to place it relative to its parent's coordinate system.  The entire subtree will be transformed by this matrix on the left.  If no matrix is provided, the identity matrix is assumed
                                                    </p>

                                                        </p>

                                                            <li><b>cone</b>, with fields "radius" (number), "height" (number), and "center" (list of 3 numbers xyz).  The default cone has radius 1 and height 1, with its base centered on (0, 0, 0).</li>
                                                            <li><b>sphere</b>, with fields "radius" (number) and "center" (list of 3 numbers xyz).  The default sphere has radius 1 and is centered at (0, 0, 0).</li>

                                                            <li><b>scene</b>, with field "filename" (string), which is a path to another JSON scene file, which should be recursively included as a child of this node.  The path is relative to the directory from which the viewer is being run.</li>

                                            The <a href = "../../../Modules/assets/js/ggslac/scenes/sample-scene.json">sample.scene.json</a> file bundled with ggslac is a fairly comprehensive example of the possibilities, including optional light, material, and camera specifications.  An annotated screenshot of the code is shown below, with the resulting scene tree superimposed on the right.  We make the following observations about this example:
                                            
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Node 2 is a "dummy node," as it has no shapes associated to it; it only has a transformation (45 degree rotation about y and a translation by 2 in the +x direction).  So it is merely used to transform the shapes below it, not to include any shapes of its own.</li>

                                                <li>
                                                    Node 3 contains a unit cube, which it scales by 2x in the x direction to turn it into a 2x1x1 rectangular prism.  To further continue up the tree to world coordinates, it is then rotated by 45 degrees about y, translated by 2 in +x, and translated by 0.5 in +y.  (Note that flipping the rotation in node 2 with the scale in node 3 would actually end up shearing the shape).
                                                </li>

                                                <li>
                                                    Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 are all "leaf nodes," as they have no children, so the tree stops there.
                                                </li>

                                                <li>
                                                    Node 6 actually contains 3 shapes, but no transformation is specified, <i>so the identity matrix is assumed for all of them</i>.  To place the shapes at different positions and to scale them in different directions, we actually rely on the shape fields (center, radius, height) instead of transformation matrices.  Though one could accomplish the translation and scaling with a matrix as well.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>

                                                    You can format JSOn however you want, but it is recommended that you include tabs consistently to help you see what nodes are at the same depth in the tree.  Basically, treat it like its own programming language and keep it readable.

                                                    I've noticed that Firefox gives more descriptive information in its console about where JSON parse errors are occurring than Chrome does.  In particular, Firefox seems to give line numbers, while Chrome flattens the code to a String.  So I'd recommend using Firefox in this assignment.

                                            <p>
                                                For this task, you will programmatically setup a bunch of scene elements in a loop.  You'll be aiming for a scene with 20 dinos orbiting around one dino, as shown in the animation below.  Think of it as a dino dance circle / congo line of sorts:
                                            </p>
                                            <img src = "DinoDanceCircle.gif">
                                            <p>
                                                  Of course, you could manually type out each dino, but that would be very tedious, so you should make code that sets up the JSON object.  To help you out, <a href = "https://github.com/ursinusgraphics/DinoDanceCircle/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">click here</a> to download some starter code.  You should edit the file <code>dino.js</code>, and then run the file <code>makeDino.html</code> to display your programmatically generated code, which you can paste into a file or into the live editor to try out.  I've started you off in <code>dino.js</code> with the beginning of the scene, including the dino at the center and a few lights.  You'll have to add to the children of the <code>scene</code> JSON object that I started you with using a loop.  The position of the dinos in a circle can be placed in the XZ plane as

                                                <h3>
                                                    \[ x = R \cos(\theta), z = R \sin(\theta) \]
                                                </h3>

                                                where <code>R</code> is the radius of the circle.  But you'll also have to do two rotations.  First, you'll need to rotate about the x-axis clockwise by 90 degrees, because the dino mesh comes in facing down.  After that, you'll have to rotate around the y-axis so that each dino faces the dino right in front of them in the circle.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                When you're finished, please submit your <code>dino.js</code> to canvas.
                                            </p>

                                            <b>Hints:</b>
                                            <div id = "tips">
                                                You'll have to do two rotations and a translation to come up with the final transformation for each dino.  You can use the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/docs/module-mat4.html">mat4</a> class in glMatrix to help you.  In particular, make use of the functions <code>fromTranslation</code>, <code>fromXRotation</code>, and <code>fromYRotation</code>.  Then, multiply them together with <code>mul</code>.  Finally, use the  <code>getMat4Array</code> method I provided to convert from a <code>glMatrix.mat4</code> object into an array that can be put directly into the transformation property of a child object in the scene file.
