                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b>Write your shaders one step at a time!</b>  Debugging is very difficult because the only output is a color per pixel.  Try to use the colors to help you debug.</li>
                                                <li>
                                                    If your shader doesn't compile, drop into the debugging console to see why.  Syntax error messages will be printed there with line numbers in the shader.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    If you get an error like the following
                                                    <p>
                                                        <code>
                                                        ERROR: 0:15: '+' : wrong operand types - no operation '+' exists that takes a left-hand operand of type 'const int' and a right operand of type 'mediump float' (or there is no acceptable conversion)
                                                        </code>
                                                    </p>
                                                    Then it probably means you need to write a number as a decimal.  There is no explicit casting, so when GLSL sees <code>10</code>, for instance, it assumes it's an integer.  So you would need to write <code>10.0</code>
                                                </li>

                                            <li>Since you're only going through a semicircle and it resets each time, you will need to set a variable that's equal to the remainder of the uniform time divided by PI.  Since the modulus % operator doesn't exist, one way you can tackle this is to use the <code>floor()</code> function instead.  Though students last year came up with a variety of workarounds.</li>

                                            We saw how taking an average of pixels nearby in a square window leads to a blurred version of an image.  Below is an example
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Original</h3>
                                        <img src = "results/RockyMountain.png">

                                        <h3>Mean in a 13x13 Window</h3>
                                        <img src = "results/RockyMountainMean.png">

                                        <p>
                                            One drawback of this in certain applications is that it blurs everything uniformly.  Particularly in applications where we want to get rid of certain types of random noise, this is not the best choice, as it removes the noise but also important high frequency image properties like edges.  For example, notice how blurry the edges between the mountains and the sky are.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            It is possible to do a smarter, edge-aware blurring by doing a special kind of <i>weighted average</i> instead of a uniform average.  Let <b>x, y</b> be the location of a pixel that we want to blur, and <b>x2, y2</b> be the coordinates of another point nearby.  Let <code>I(x, y)</code> and <code>I(x2, y2)</code> be the RGB vectors of each of these pixels, and let <b>&#963<SUB>d</SUB></b> and <b>&#963<SUB>r</SUB></b> be two scale parameters.  Then the weight for the point at location <b>(x2, y2)</b> is as follows.
                                        </p>

                                        <h2>

                                            \[ w(x_2, y_2) = e^{- \left( \frac{(x_2-x)^2 + (y_2-y)^2}{2 \sigma_d^2} \right) } * e^{- \left( \frac{||I(x, y) - I(x_2, y_2)||^2}{2 \sigma_r^2} \right) }  \]
										</h2>
										
										<p>
											To perform a bilateral filter, simply multiply each pixel <b>I(x2, y2)</b> by these weights over all (x2, y2) in some window, and then divide by the sum of the weights.  Below is an example of a bilateral filter with <b>&#963<SUB>d</SUB> = 0.05</b> and <b>&#963<SUB>r</SUB> = 0.2</b>.
										</p>
										<img src = "results/RockyMountainBilateral.png">

										<p>
											Notice how all of the edges (mountain/mountain boundaries, mountain/sky boundaries, road boundaries) are intact, but the finer details have been smoothed out.  This is precisely what the bilateral filter was meant to accomplish.  Not only can this help get rid of noise, but you see it also has an interesting cartoon-like aesthetic, so it can be used for artistic purposes as well.

										<div id = "tips">
											<b>Tips:</b>
											<ul>
												<li>Recall that <b>||v||</b> is the magnitude of a vector <b>v</b>, and <b>||v||<SUP>2</SUP></b> is the squared magnitude of a vector <b>v</b>.  Also, recall that  <b>||v||<SUP>2</SUP></b> can be obtained as the dot product of <b>v</b> and itself.</li>
												<li>
													You should definitely declare at least two accumulator variables outside of your loop: one which stores the weighted vectors sum of the pixels in a neighborhood, and the other which stores the sum of the weights, which you should divide by after the loop.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

										<b>NOTE for the curious:</b>
										<p>
											Shaders are particularly helpful for this filter is because, unlike embossing, the laplacian, and a weighted average whose weights only depend on location, the bilateral filter is <i>nonlinear</i>.  What this means is, unlike those other filters, it's not possible to apply a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem">Fourier transform trick</a> to speed the bilateral filter up, so we're stuck actually slogging through the weighted mean calculation.  So it's very nice to be able to do this in parallel.

											Recall that the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> states that every non-zero polynomial <b>f(z)</b> of degree <b>n</b> in a single complex variable has <b>n</b> complex roots, or numbers <b>z</b> where <b>f(z) = 0</b>.  For example, the polynomial

											<h3>
												\[ f(z) = z^3 - 1 \]
											</h3>

											Is of degree 3, and so it has 3 roots.  They happen to be as below (you can check with complex multiplication that these numbers indeed give 0 when you plug them in)

												\[ z = \left\{ 1, -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i, -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right\} \]

											But in general, it's pretty tough to figure out what the roots are.  That's where <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method">Newton's method</a> comes in.  If you have an initial guess <b>z0</b> of what a root might be, then you can perform iterations to update your guess, and it will get closer and closer to a true root if you are within a "basin of attraction."  In particular, the update rules for a polynomial equation <b>f(z)</b> are

											<h3>
												\[ z_{n+1} = z_n - \frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)} \]
											</h3>

											where <b>f'</b> is the derivative of <b>f</b>, and the division is <a href = "https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexDivision.html">complex division</a>.  What's really strange about the above procedure, however, is that which root you converge to can be <i>extremely</i> sensitive to your initial starting point in some places.  In particular, if you plot the roots in different colors at their starting point, then it will form a fractal!  Below are a few examples
										</p>

										<h3>z<SUP>3</SUP>-1</h3>
										<img src = "results/zcube-1.gif">

										<h3>z<SUP>10</SUP>-1</h3>
										<img src = "results/z10-1.gif">

										<h3>2z<SUP>7</SUP>-z<SUP>6</SUP>-1</h3>
										<img src = "results/2z7-z6-1.gif">

										<p>
											Your job will be to implement Newton's method and to draw a pixel with a color according to the root it converges to.  The starting point at each pixel has been provided to you as <code>z</code>.  The coefficients of the polynomial you're solving are represented in the uniform array <code>uCoeffs</code>.
										</p>

										<p>
											This is a task that you should definitely do in stages.  You will be editing the file <code>newton.frag</code> and viewing the results in <code>newton.html</code>.  A series of skeleton methods and comments have been provided to guide you through this.  As you're going along, recall that the number of iterations of the loop needs to be known at compile time, so you'll often want to loop up to the constant <code>MAX_DEGREE</code>, even if you're nowhere near that degree for what you're doing.
										</p>

										<h3>Step 1: Implement complex powers</h3>
										<p>
											The first thing you should do is fill in the method <code>pow</code> which raises a complex number <b>z</b> to a power of <b>n</b>.  Then, if you let 
										</p>
										<p>
											<code>zret = pow(z, n)</code>
										</p>
										
										<p>
										and you color as 
										</p>

										<p>
											<code>gl_FragColor = vec4(zret[0], zret[1], 0.5*(zret[0]+zret[1]), 1.0);</code>
										</p>

										<p>
											Then you should get the following images for different powers.
										</p>

										<table>
											<tr>
												<td><h3>z<SUP>2</SUP></h3></td>
												<td><h3>z<SUP>3</SUP></h3></td>
												<td><h3>z<SUP>4</SUP></h3></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><img src = "results/z2.png"></td>
												<td><img src = "results/z3.png"></td>
												<td><img src = "results/z4.png"></td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<p>
											<b>Do not proceed until these images look right!</b> 
										</p>

										<h3>Step 2: Implement <code>polynomial</code> and <code>polynomialDeriv</code> methods</h3>
										<p>
											Now that you have the <code>pow</code> method implemented for complex powers, you can evaluate a complex polynomial by adding to together all of its powers scaled by the appropriate coefficients.  You can also evaluate its derivative according to the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_rule">power rule</a>.  More information is provided in the comments.
										</p>

										<h3>Step 3: Complex Division</h3>
										<p>
											Fill in the <code>complexDiv</code> function to perform the division of two complex numbers.  Have a look at the <a href = "https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexDivision.html">formula on Wolfram Mathworld</a>.
										</p>

										<h3>Step 4: Putting It All Together</h3>
										<p>
											Now you're ready to write newton's method finally.  Replace the line <code>z = pow(z, 2)</code> instead with a loop that applies <code>MAX_ITERS</code> iterations of Newton's method, using the functions that you wrote above
										</p>

										<h3>
											\[ z_{n+1} = z_n - \frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)} \]
										</h3>

										<p>
											You can color the root you come up with using the code provided:
										</p>

										<code>
											z = (z + 1.0)/2.0;
										</code><BR>
										<code>
											gl_FragColor = vec4(z[0], z[1], 0.5*(z[0]+z[1]), 1.0);
										</code>

										<p>
											Have fun, and enjoy the beautiful pictures!
										</p>

                                        <p>
                                            Do something creative with shaders!  The sky is the limit here!  For instance, think about how you might combine textures with some of the other effects we saw.  Animations would be particularly cool.  The winner will receive 5 extra credit points.  You may do a buddy submission for the art contest as well, but I will judge them a little bit harder.
                                        </p>
