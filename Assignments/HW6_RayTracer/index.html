										<h2><a name = "overview">Overview</a></h2>
										<p>
										This assignment will walk students through the construction of a real time ray tracer using a mix of Javascript and GLSL.  All of the assignments we have done so far have built up to this point!  Since we are using GLSL, all rays are traced in parallel, which makes this <i>substantially faster</i> than a CPU implementation of ray tracing. (NOTE: This was heavily inspired by a <a href = "https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos426/assign/A3/">recent assignment</a> in Princeton's computer graphics class, which is a modern version of the assignment I did a decade ago in the same class).  You should expect this assignment to be very challenging and painful at times, but it is also <i>incredibly</i> rewarding.  So stick with it!
                                        </p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Scoring</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This assignment is out of <b>120 points</b>.  85 of these points are <b>required tasks</b> that everyone has to do.  Beyond that, there are 100 points up for grabs which you can choose from to pursue your interests and "make the assignment your own."  Any points that you get beyond 35 will apply to extra credit at a rate of 1 point, 4/5 points, 4/5^2 points, 4/5^3 points, etc.  The required points and the optional points will be graded independently.  So, for instance, if you get an 80/85 on the required points and you earn 50 optional points, then your final score will be <b>80 + 35 + 4.8 = 119.8/120</b> points, which is quite a formidable score!
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Since this is a very intense assignment, you are allowed to work very closely with other students in the class in a <a href = "../../index.html#buddy">buddy</a> capacity, and that permits looking at each others' code as you're debugging.  <b>But I expect each student to submit their own code.</b>  Please indicate to me on your README who your buddies were.
                                        </p>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                <a href = "RayTracerSkeleton.zip">Click here</a> to download the skeleton code for this assignment.
                                                <p>
                                                <b>NOTE:</b>  You will only need to edit <code>raytracer.frag</code> to complete all of the tasks in the assignment.
                                                </p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                You should definitely work on this using the live web server in VS Code.  The entry point is the file <code><a href = "Assignment4_RayTracer/RayViewer.html">RayViewer.html</a></code>
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>


                                        <h3>Debugging GUI</h3>
                                        <p>
                                        The main file where you view the results of your ray tracer is <code><a href = "Assignment4_RayTracer/RayViewer.html">RayViewer.html</a></code>.  In this file, you can switch back between your ray tracer and the standard object-first shader with Lambertian and specular Blinn-Phong shading.  You can use the object-first view to help you debug.  The GUI also allows you to change the positions and colors of lights and cameras real time.  Use this to your advantage to probe your program as you're debugging and to generate the most aesthetically pleasing scene if you plan to submit to the art contest.  Below is a screenshot of the object-first view.
                                        </p>
                                            
                                            <img src = "ObjectFirstView.png">
                                        
                                        <p>
                                        And below is an example of a ray tracer with all of the required tasks and some of the optional tasks:</p>
                                            <img src = "RayTracingView.png">
                                        
                                            
                                            <h3>Scene Graphs:</h3>
                                            <p>
                                            This assignment uses JSON scene graphs to specify virtual worlds.  Please refer to <a href = "../HW2_SceneTrees/">assignment 2</a> for more details on the syntax.  By default, the scene graph <code>sample-scene.json</code> (pictured above) is the scene that's loaded.  This has all features that you would want to show across all required tasks, and most features you would want to show for the optional tasks (except for cylinders and cones).  Have a look at that file for example syntax.  Note that can also edit the parameters of the lights and materials real time in the debugging GUI.

                                                <h3>General Tips:</h3>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><b>Write your shaders one step at a time!</b>  Debugging is very difficult because the only output is a color per pixel.  Try to use the colors to help you debug.  Some more specific suggestions will be provided in each task.</li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        If your shader doesn't compile, drop into the debugging console to see why.  Syntax error messages will be printed there with line numbers in the shader.  Step 1 is definitely just getting things to compile!
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        As your shader gets longer, the compile time may increase.  This will be particularly noticeable when you use more reflections.  So keep the number of reflections to a minimum when you start off.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        If your shader doesn't update, you may need to do a "hard refresh" and reset your cache.  This seems to happen particularly in Google Chrome.  The keyboard shortcut for this is <code>CTRL+SHIFT+R</code>
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        When you write a loop, you cannot have a variable number of iterations.  So you will have to have a maximum number of iterations, and then <code>break</code> when appropriate (you can use break here!).  I have tried to take care of most of these kinds of loops for you, but if you decide to do loops in one of the tasks, be mindful of this.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        If you get an error like the following
                                                        <p>
                                                            <code>
                                                            ERROR: 0:15: '+' : wrong operand types - no operation '+' exists that takes a left-hand operand of type 'const int' and a right operand of type 'mediump float' (or there is no acceptable conversion)
                                                            </code>
                                                        </p>
                                                        Then it probably means you need to write a number as a decimal.  There is no explicit casting, so when GLSL sees <code>10</code>, for instance, it assumes it's an integer.  So you would need to write <code>10.0</code>

You should then call this function from the appropriate place within <code>getPhong(...)</code> and scale the light color by this value.

                                                                    The shadows will look better the more random samples you take, but the rendering engine will slow down substantially once you exceed 20 or so samples.  So you might want to position your camera with a lower number of samples, save it in the scene, and then reload the scene using a higher number of samples for the art contest.
                                                                </li>

                                                        <p>
                                                            If any of the components of the transmission coefficient <code>kt</code> of a material are greater than zero, then perform a transmission <i>instead of</i> a reflection (since we can only do tail recursion in GLSL); that is, shoot a ray through the material in a direction determined by Snell's law
        
                                                            \[ \nu_i \sin(\theta_i) = \nu_j \sin(\theta_j) \]
        
                                                            where <b>theta<sub>i</sub></b> is the incident angle, and <b>theta<sub>j</sub></b> is the transmitted angle on the other side.  You can assume that the refraction index <b>nu</b> outside of the material is 1, and the refraction index inside of the material is the <code>refraction</code> field of the material struct.
                    
                                                        </p>
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        <p>
                                                        <h4>Code To Write</h4> Fill in appropriate parts of the "recursive" loop in the <code>main()</code> function.  You will be adding something in addition to the code you have to do reflections, and you will be doing one or the other (so have an if statement to do either reflection or refraction).  You should accumulate a weight term as a product of <code>ks</code> <i>and</i> <code>kt</code> terms as you go along, depending on whether you decide to reflect or refract, respectively.
                                                        </p>

                                                        <p>
                                                            You can use the implementation of WebGL's <a href = "https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/refract.xhtml">refract</a> function to help you.  They use a trick with the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_trigonometric_identity">Pythagorean trig identity</a> (sin(x) = sqrt(1 - cos<SUP>2</SUP>(x)) ) so that it's possible to calculate the sin using dot products.  There is one major difference that you'll need in your implementation for full credit, however.  If they find that there is no real solution to the equation, they return the zero vector.  But at that point, you should instead return the reflection.  This simulates what's known as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection">total internal reflection</a>, and it's what gives the "bubble effect" when the index of refraction in the sphere is less than 1.  So you can start with their code but tweak it a bit.
                                                        </p>

                                                        <p>
                                                            The animation below shows a working implementation.  Note how when the index of refraction inside the sphere is 1, it's simply a transparent object.  On the other hand, when the index is greater than 1, it reflects a warped version of what's in front of it upside down.  And when the index of refraction is less than 1, it looks like a bubble (since this is what would happen with air having a smaller index of refraction relative to the water that surrounds it).
                                                        </p>

                                            Implement antialiasing to get rid of the "jaggies" that occur on boundaries of objects, by randomly sampling rays with some "jitter" around the initial ray.
