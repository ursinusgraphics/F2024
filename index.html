												I grew up right around the corner in the Montgomery County and attended <a href = "https://www.udsd.org/schools/udhs/">Upper Dublin High school</a> (class of 2007).  I then did my undergraduate degree in <a href = "https://ee.princeton.edu/">Electrical Engineering</a> at Princeton University and my master's and Ph.D. degrees in <a href = "https://ece.duke.edu/">Electrical And Computer Engineering</a> at Duke University (heavily studying math and CS along the way).  I finally started my dream job at Ursinus College in Fall of 2019!  You can read more about my interests on my <a href = "http://www.ctralie.com/">professional web site</a>.  Looking forward to getting to know everyone as we work through this course together!

											<h3>Course Description</h3>
											<p>
												Computer graphics is the study and use of computer algorithms to simulate what humans see in the natural world, or to procedurally generate visual art.  In essence, computer graphics is an attempt to teach a computer broadly how to do the job of a visual artist (and beyond!).  For the purposes of this course, a broad taxonomy of computer graphics is three-fold:
												<ol>
													<li><a href = "index.html#rendering">Rendering</a>, or the generation of images of virtual worlds (including photorealistic images or chosen artistic aesthetic, such as Pixar movies)
													</li>
													
													<li><a href = "index.html#shape">3D Shape representation and manipulation</a>, or geometric data structures and algorithms to enable efficient and intuitive design of 2D surfaces and 3D volumes in 3D space</li>
	
													<li><a href = "index.html#animation">3D Animation</a>, or the modeling of dynamics in scenes over time, often simulating aspects of physics in our natural world.</li>
												</ol>
											</p>
	
											<p>
												This hands on capstone course will be a breadth-first introduction to the world of 3D computer graphics.  Rather than teaching the user interfaces of tools such as <a href = "https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> and <a href = "https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview">Maya</a>, which are commonly used in video game design and movies, and which might be taught in a <a href = "https://www.scad.edu/">3D design curriculum</a>, we instead focus on the <i>technologies themselves</i> behind these programs.  As such, the course will have a more mathematical and algorithmic focus.  In particular, students will write code to implement vanilla tools from the ground up to design 3D scenes, to perform <a href = "index.html#rendering">3D rendering</a>, to design and manipulate <a href = "index.html#shape">3D shapes</a>, and to help automate certain aspects of <a href = "index.html#animation">3D animation</a>, among <a href = "index.html#schedule">other things</a>.  The course will culminate in a final project related to the digital humanities, or related to video game design for those doing a <a href = "#linq">linked inquiry</a>.
											</p>
											
	
	
	
											<h3><a name = "goals">Learning Goals</a></h3>
											<p>
											<ol>
												<li>
													Learn the unique issues that arise when implementing mathematical concepts in code.
												</li>
	
												<li>
													Develop creative strategies to debug programs using visual output.
												</li>
	
												<li>
													Articulate the way mathematics, physics, and computer science work together in an application.
												</li>
	
											</ol>
											</p>
	
											<h3><a name = "objectives">Learning Objectives</a></h3>
											<p>
											<ol>
	
												<li>
													Learn to write <i>interoperable</i> code at the interface of multiple, heterogenous languages (particularly the interaction of Javascript with GLSL).  This is a very important skill for a professional software developer, since different languages have different strengths, and you will often need to combine them to leverage their joint strengths.
												</li>
	
												<li>
													"Reflect" on how humans see, and compare the tradeoffs made by different algorithms that try to simulate this process virtually.
												</li>
	
												<li>
													Develop fluency with more complicated, object-oriented data structures, such as the half-edge data structure for triangle meshes.
												</li>
	
											</ol>
											</p>

												<h3><a name = "linq">Linked Inquiry with DIGS-250</a></h3>

												<p>
													This course qualifies as a <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/catalog/the-core/core-requirements/#linked">linked inquiry course (LINQ)</a> if you take DIGS-250: Introduction to Game Studies during the same semester.  This is optional, but it could be a great opportunity to fulfill the LINQ requirement for the new core, particularly if you're on the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/mathematics-and-computer-science/requirements/">game design track</a> in the computer science major.
												</p>
												
												<p>
													DIGS-250 and CS-476 examine game design and development from different lens, or ways of asking. Linking these courses may be a good choice for you if you wish to specialize in digital game development. DIGS-250 introduces you to the field of game studies, game culture and effects, the game design and development process, and the basics of video and computer game development. CS-476 is a capstone course in the computer science department that teaches the intricacies of creating 3D computer graphics, animations, and rendering using programming and applied math. It provides more hands-on experience with the technologies used in the computer industry that make digital game design possible.
												</p>
												
												<p>
													There are several connected assignments you will complete to LINQ these courses:
													<ul>
														<li>
															In the second unit of CS-476 on <a href = "#animation">3D animation</a>, you will explore several assignments that overlap with game design.  First, you will create 3D scene graphs in mini assignment 2, which you will use to model 3D virtual worlds hierarchically.  Then, in assignment 3, you will implement a Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) system and triangle mesh skinning to move a 3D body model around your screen. These assignments will highlight the linear algebra and vector math that go into creating 3D graphics and animations that appear in digital games. Then, shortly thereafter in DIGS-250, You will create a mini-digital game in <a href = "https://www.construct.net/en">Construct</a>, which provides industrial strength implementations of scene graphs and other animation tools.
														</li>
														<li>
															In both courses, you will discuss the technical hurdles that prevent virtual reality from being more widely adopted.  We will discuss this in CS 476 at the end of the <a href = "#rendering">rendering unit</a> once we have a deep understanding of the time complexity of real time rendering pipelines.
														 </li>
														 <li>
															You will create a computer or video game in DIGS-250 for your final game project and in CS-476, you will create a plugin building on that game using code and concepts related to rendering, animation, or shape modeling. 
														 </li>
														 <li>
															<a name = "linqreflection">Final LINQ Reflection:</a> A final reflection in both courses will include questions related to scoping a project and how various interdisciplinary approaches can help you better understand core questions and themes in game studies, culture, and development.
														 </li>
													</ul>
												</p>





											<hr>
											<h2><a name = "logistics">Technology Logistics</a></h2>
											<p>
												We will be using a zoo of technologies in the course, as has become standard in 21st century work environments.  Below is a table summarizing what kinds of communications/activities occur via each technology, and below that there are more details on everything.  This is admittedly complex, and it will take some getting used to, but it will be worth it once we get it nailed down.  
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>NOTE:</b> I will repeat the same announcements across e-mail and Discord, so you don't have to check all both for announcements.

												<a name = "sensitive">*</a>: For <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act">privacy reasons</a>, anything of a personal nature, and particularly things that have to with educational records (e.g. grades), need to be kept within Ursinus sanctioned platforms like Outlook e-mail and Microsoft Teams.
											</p>
	
											<h3>Canvas</h3>
											<p>
												We will be using Canvas, but only to submit assignments and to store all of the grades.  I will also keep all of the due dates current on the calendar there, as students have appreciated this common space for all of their classes in the past.
											</p>

	
											
											<h3><a name = "discord">Discord / Anonymous Questions</a></h3>
											<p>
												To facilitate informal, class-wide discussions about the class, as well as <a href = "#buddy">buddy group coding</a> with screen sharing, we will have a Discord channel for the class.  My goal is for this to turn into a flourishing area to work through <a href = "#confusion">confusion</a> and to share ideas as a group.  
											</p>

											<h4>Voltaire Anonymous Questions</h4>
											<p>
												All questions are welcome!  To help break down the barrier of asking questions, we will be using the chat bot <a href = "https://nminchow.github.io/VoltaireWeb/">Voltaire</a> so students can ask questions anonymously.  This has worked very well in the past.  To use Voltaire, send a <b>direct message</b> to the Voltaire bot with the following syntax:
											</p>

											<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
												!volt send_server "CS 476 Fall 2022" channel_name message]]></script>  

											<p>
												where <code>channel_name</code> is the name of the channel you want to post to, and <code>message</code> is the text you want to send.  Below is an example:
											</p>
											<img src = "Voltaire.png" width="70%">

											<p>
												<b>Answer:</b>
												<div width="200">
													<h4>
														\[ u \cdot v = |u| |v| \cos(\theta) \]
													</h4>
												</div>

											</p>

											<p></p>

											<h4>In Class Anonymous Questions</h4>
											<p>
												In addition to Voltaire, I'll be running a bot during class that accepts questions to help quieter student who want to participate anonymously to do so.  I've found this sort of thing to be particularly helpful with students from underrepresented groups.  To ask a question during class, visit <a href = "http://mathcs.ursinus.edu/question">http://mathcs.ursinus.edu/question</a>.
											</p>

											

											<h4>Other Rules</h4>
											<p>
												<b>Do not</b> send me direct messages or anything of a sensitive nature (e.g. grades) over Discord.  Instead, use <a href = "#teams">Microsoft Teams</a> or e-mail for that, since those transactions are locked down better under Ursinus control.
											</p>


											
	
	
											<h3><a name = "teams">Microsoft Teams</a></h3>
											<p>
												For one on one direct messages with me, and for <a href = "#buddy">buddy group coding</a> with screen sharing, we will be using  <a href = "https://insights.ursinus.edu/display/LEI/Microsoft+Teams">Microsoft Teams</a>, which is linked to your Office suite through Ursinus, so you are automatically enrolled.  This is an easy platform for students to initiate video sharing, so I highly recommend it for group work.
											</p>

											
											<hr>
											<h2><a name = "readings">Readings</a></h2>
											<p>
												There will be no official textbook for the course.  Instead, I will be teaching you with occasional pre-class modules, and I will sometimes link to supplementary resources from the <a href = "index.html#schedule">schedule</a>.	
											</p>


											<hr>
											<h2><a name = "deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
											


											<h3><a href = "Assignments/index.html">Assignments</a> </h3>

											<p>
												The bulk of the grade in the course will be earned by completing roughly 4 small scale individual programming assignments, and a two large scale programming assignments.  Be sure to start them early!  Note that <a href = "#collaboration">collaboration and sharing rules</a> differ slightly between the individual assignments and the large assignments.
											</p>
	
											
											<h4>Programming Languages</h4>
	
											<h4><a name = "javascript">Javascript</a></h4>
											<p>
											Most assignments will be written in Javascript, but no assumption will be made about prior Javascript knowledge!  Those who can write code in any one of Java, C++, or Python can quickly learn the differences (it has syntax like Java but the typing/runtime/flexibility of Python).  There are four main reasons for using Javascript in the course:
											<ol>
											<li>It is widely used in modern web programming, so it will be useful in many projects beyond this course</li>
											<li>It requires no special software to run, and it works in the browser.  As a result, it makes it easy to develop on nearly any computer, and it allows students to share their work online</li>
											<li>Since it runs in the browser, user interfaces are easy to design for the assignments</li>
											<li>People on the more mathematical side get to learn powerful web graphics programming techniques for communicating their ideas in the future with live demos on their web sites, rather than static images</li>
											</ol>
											Students will make heavy use of the <a href = "http://glmatrix.net/">glMatrix</a> library.  Skeleton code with GUIs powered by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> to render 3D shapes will be provided on most assignments</p>
	
											<h4>GLSL</h4>
	
											<p>
												Students will also make use of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)</a>, which has syntax and programming paradigms similar to C, but which is designed for the massively parallel hardware of the GPU.  The language is a bit idiosyncratic, but it is used heavily in industry, and it's possible to do incredible things with it.
											</p>
											
											
											<h4><a name = "debugging">Debugging Principles</a></h4>
											<p>
												If you're taking this course, then you've certainly had experience with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a>, but it is a skill you will still need to work on, so you should expect to hit some roadblocks.  In fact, it is time consuming and difficult even for very experienced programmers.  So do not be hard on yourself if your programs don't work the first time around (they rarely do, even if you've been programming for decades!).
											</p>

											<p>
												I have had nearly 20 years of programming experience at this point, and I have learned the hard way what works and what doesn't.  Here are my main debugging principles in a nutshell
											</p>
											<ol>
												<li>
													<a name = "adequatetime"></a>Leave yourself <b>adequate time</b> to work on the assignments, because the amount of time it takes to resolve issues can be unpredictable.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "smallbits"></a>Write <b>small bits of code and test them right away.</b>  Don't write a wall of code and test it, only to find out that something doesn't work.  By contrast, if you write bits at a time, you will know right away what code you wrote caused things to be wrong.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "scientificmethod"></a>Apply the <b>scientific method</b>: have in mind hypothesis for what might be wrong, design a quick experiment to test your hypothesis, draw conclusions, and repeat.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "failquickly"></a><b>Fail quickly</b>.  If you're working on a larger scale program that processes a lot of data, do not wait for several minutes for data to load every time you make a small change.  Instead, come up with the minimum, simplest experiment you possibly can which will tell you whether your code is correct or not.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name="testcode"></a>Don't forget that you can <b>write code to help you automate debugging</b>.  Otherwise, it's sometimes tedious to repeat the same steps over and over again as you're changing things.
												</li>
												<li>
													<a name = "walkaway"></a><b>Know when to walk away.</b>  We often get stuck in loops wanting to resolve things, but then our logical thinking goes out the window and we start randomly trying different things.  Even if you're up against the clock, it is often good to take a little break and come back again a little bit later.
												</li>
											</ol>
	

											<h3><a name = "preclass">Class Engagement / Pre-Class Work</a></h3>
                                            
                                            <p>
												It's easier to learn a difficult subject like computer graphics by going through a number of examples on each topic beyond the examples in the large assignments.  Because of this, we will often do small programming exercises and experiments in class related to a topic that we're learning.  At times, I may ask you to read over a description of an exercise or to read some notes about a new topic before class so we can go more deeply into the examples.  I may also ask you to hand in something small related to the class exercises to make sure you were putting effort in during class.  This will all make up a small part of your <a href = "#grading">grade</a> in the class.

The ultimate goal of such techniques is to make photorealistic images that look like what a camera might take in the real world, though, as we will see, this is quite challenging.  In the process of attempting to meet this goal, we will think about how light bounces around in the real world and how humans see that light, and we will discuss algorithms that attempt to mimic this.  To this end, students will start off implementing a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray tracer</a>, which is a non-realtime rendering technique, but which allows for visually stunning effects with reflection, refraction, and shadows.  We will then talk about the more traditional rendering pipeline, which leads to visually inferior but interactive images.  Students will learn the basics of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a> / <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">GLSL</a> Javascript API, which implements this rendering pipeline.<p><b>Big Concepts And Questions:</b><ul><li>What is object-first rendering, and what is pixel first rendering?

												Computer science is a field that has <a href = "https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality">historically been and continues to be</a> steeped in inequalities.  We have a double dose of this in computer graphics, since, first of all, modern work in this area is adjacent to AI and machine learning, which themselves have <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbcG7e2dBj0">added fuel to the fire</a>.  Moreover, the "gamer culture" that has been adjacent to computer graphics has had a lot of issues, most prominently the impact of the <a href = "https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws">Gamergate campaign</a> against women in the field.  So there is a special role and responsibility that those who have graphics knowledge have to play in being good stewards around both the technology and within work environments.
											
											</p>
											<p>
												Within class interactions, my goal is to foster a environment in which students across all axes of diversity feel <b>welcome and valued, both by me and by their peers</b>.  Axes of diversity include, but are not limited to, age, background, beliefs, race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity/gender expression (feel free to tell me in person or over e-mail which pronouns I should use), national origin, religious affiliation, and sexual orientation.  Discrimination of any form will not be tolerated.
											</p>

											<p>
												A slightly more subtle thing that we want to watch out for in class is not to assume anything about others based on implicit biases.  <b>I have heard from quieter students at Ursinus from different backgrounds in the past that they sometimes feel their contributions aren't valued from their group members and that they're talked over during collaborations</b>.  So be mindful of this and be sure to curb this behavior in yourself if you notice it...this is something immediate you can to do help stem the <a href = "https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/fixing-leaky-pipeline">leaky pipeline in our field</a>.
											</p>

											<p>
												<a name = "confusion">.</a>Furthermore, I want all students to feel <b>comfortable expressing their opinions or confusion</b> at any point in the course, as long as they do so respectfully.  As I will stress over and over, being confused is an important part of the process of learning computer science.  Learning computer science and struggling to grow is <a href = "https://i0.wp.com/katielmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1_9HzbByi2Uzit8474Rp4ZPg-1.jpg?w=550&ssl=1">not always comfortable</a>, but I want it to feel safe.  In other words, I will regularly keep you at the boundary of your comfort zone with challenging, real-world assignments, but I want you to feel comfortable with me and your peers and respected as a learner during the process<a name = "communication">.</a>
											</p>

											<p>
												Finally, I am aware that, particularly during the pandemic, there are a variety of factors that may make it difficult to perform at your best level in class.  At Ursinus, we are fortunate to have quite a mix of students from different backgrounds, many of whom need to work part time, and an increasing number of whom are commuters and have family obligations.  If you find yourself having difficulty performing at the level that you want and/or turning assignments in on time because of any of these issues, <b>communicate with me</b>, and we can come up with a solution together (I will gently reach out if I notice any slips even if you don't communicate).  This is an exciting capstone course, and I want to work to keep your excitement alive, regardless of your personal circumstances.  We will get you through the course as long as the lines of communication are open and we work together.  <u><b>You belong in CS!</b></u>
											</p>


											<h3>Classroom Attendance And Etiquette</h3>

											<p>
												Students are expected to attend class in person.  We're shooting for <b>engagement</b> over mere attendance; students are expected to be active in class exercises and to be fully invested in the class (i.e. no internet browsing).  Students who are unable to attend class for significant reasons (whether isolation or quarantine for students who have received a positive test, those experiencing Covid-related symptoms while awaiting test results, or other issues that make it difficult to attend class) should work pro-actively to make up any <a href = "#preclass">class exercises</a> that they missed.  To help with this, I will do my best to put up Youtube videos from other instructors on topics that we cover.
											</p>

											<p>
												Finally, students are expected to follow any college policy requiring mask wearing on campus, in addition to following any guidance faculty provide for their individual classes.Masks should be available in every academic building, if needed.
											</p>



											<h3>Maximizing Your Communal Experience</h3>
											<p>
												Here are ways students can maximize their experience as a class community, and which <b>could lead to extra credit in certain situations</b>.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Helping to teach a student a topic during student office hours.</li>
												<li>Certain calls for participation in class</li>
												<li>Particularly helpful or insightful messages on Discord</li>
												<li>Finding mistakes in class notes or on the assigned homework </li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Discord Communication Policy</h3>
											Since this is a class-wide communication, the following rules apply to online communication
											<ul>
												<li>
													Students are expected to be respectful and mindful of the <a href = "#environment">classroom environment and inclusivity standards</a>.  They are equally applicable to a virtual environment as they are in class.</li>

												<li>
													Students <b>are not</b> permitted to publicly share direct answers or questions which might completely give away answers to any homework problems.  When in doubt, send me a direct message.
												</li>

												<li>
													I will answer questions real time during any office hours that are virtual.  Otherwise, I will make every attempt to respond within 24 hours on weekdays.  <i>I cannot be expected to respond at all on Saturdays or Sundays or outside of 10AM-8PM on weekdays</i>, so plan accordingly.  (Of course, students can and should still respond to each other outside of these intervals, when appropriate).
                                                </li>
											</ul>

											<p>
											The points above are part of a more general term referred to as "<b>netiquette</b>."  Refer to the chart below, provided by <a href = "http://blogs.onlineeducation.touro.edu/15-rules-netiquette-online-discussion-boards/">Touro College</a>

											<h2><a name = "collaboration">Collaboration Policy</a></h2>

											<h3>Overall Philosophy</h3>
											<p>
											    The collaboration policy for this class walks the line between encouraging openness and collaboration during a challenging learning process, while also making sure that each students is progressing technically at an individual level without relying on 100% on other classmates.  Communication between students is allowed (and encouraged!) on most assignments, but it is expected that every student's code or writeups will be completely distinct.  Do not copy code off of the Internet.  Cite any sources in addition to materials linked from the course website that you used to help in crafting your code and completing the assignment.
                                            </p>
											
											<h3><a name = "buddy">Assignment Buddies</a></h3>
                                            <p>
                                                To encourage collaboration, students will be allowed (not required) to choose one or more "<b>buddies</b>" to work "near" during the programming assignments.  Students are still expected to submit their own solutions, but they are allowed to provide substantial help to each other, and even to look at each others' code during the process.  <b>Students should indicate their buddies in the README upon assignment submission.</b>  Let me know if you would like a buddy but are having trouble finding one.
											</p>
											

											<h3>Collaboration Scenarios Table</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Below is a table spelling out in more detail when and how you are allowed to share code with people (table style cribbed from <a href = "https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos126/syllabus.html">Princeton CS 126</a>).  </p>

                                                If the collaboration policy has been violated in any way, regardless of intent, then it may be an academic dishonesty case, and it will be referred to <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/184-">the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs</a>.  I am required to make this report in every occurrence, so it is best to speak with me first if there are any questions about the policy or expectations. You should feel free to have these conversations with me anytime prior to making your submission without fear of penalty. 
											</p>
											
											<p>
												On a more personal note, though a willful violation of academic honesty may seem merely transactional to a student, faculty take violations very personally, as they are disrespectful to the time and effort we put into our courses.  I would also like to emphasize that <b>your reputation is much more important than your grades</b>.  The recommendations we as faculty write go a long way, and we are much happier to write positive recommendations for students with lower grades who show grit and growth than we are to write recommendations for students with higher grades who have cheated.

										<HR>
											<h2><a name = "other">Other Resources / Policies</a></h2>

											<h3><a name = "accommodations">Accommodations</a></h3>

											<p>
												In addition to our general awareness diversity, Ursinus College is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities.  Students with a disability should contact the Directory of Disability Services ASAP.  Dolly Singley is located in the Center for Academic Support in the lower level of Myrin Library.  Visit <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/students-with-disabilities/current-students-/">this link</a> for more information on the process.  I will do my best to accommodate your requests, and they will be kept completely confidential.
											</p>

											<h3><a name = "tutoring">One on One Tutoring</a></h3>
											<p>
												One on one tutoring for up to two hours per week is available through the institute for student success.  <a href = "https://ursinus.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MD0p25wtqMFL25">Click here</a> to fill out a Qualtrics survey if you'd like to take advantage of this.
											</p>

											<h3>Let's Talk</h3>
											<p>
												Mental health care is increasingly recognized as a crucial service for the undergraduate population.  Visit <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/wellness-center/">this link</a> for more information about complementary counseling services provided by the college.  The Wellness Center has a virtual drop-in crisis hour at 2-3 pm each weekday, which is available for students in crisis who need to be seen immediately by a clinician.  If you are still hesitant to go, take me (Professor Tralie) as an example of someone who has benefited greatly from talk therapy and medication in the past.  I am happy to discuss this in student office hours in more detail.
											</p>
											<p>
												Beyond that, please have a look at <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFxdMcPxRnCqnH6iLDIo4S2zLqSX9ltapLJJlz5uWKM/edit">this document</a> for a variety of resources related to mental health at Ursinus.
											</p>
											<p>
												Finally, be aware that there are resources outside of mental health care proper to address some core sources of mental stress and strain, such as time management and writing at the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/institute-for-student-success/">Institute for Student Success</a> and the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/center-for-writing-and-speaking/">Center for Writing And Speaking</a>.
											</p>

											<h3>Title IX</h3>
											<p>
												Title IX is a federal law, under which it is prohibited to discriminate on the basis of gender. The <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/prevention-and-advocacy/title-ix/">Title IX Coordinator</a> is available to receive inquiries and to investigate allegations in this regard. 
											</p>

											<h3>Inclement Weather Policy (aka COVID Policy)</h3>
											<p>
												In the event that the College closes due to inclement weather or other circumstances (such as a COVID lockdown), our in-person class sessions, drop-in student office hours, or other meetings will not be held. I will contact you regarding our plan with regard to rescheduling the class or the material, any assignments that are outstanding, and how we can move forward with the material (for example, any readings or remote discussions that we can apply). If necessary, I may schedule online virtual sessions in lieu of class sessions, and will contact you with information about how to participate in those. I will communicate this plan to the department so that it can be posted on my office door if it is feasible to do so. This policy and procedure will also apply in the event that the College remains open but travel conditions are hazardous or not otherwise conducive to holding class as normal. Should another exigent circumstance arise (for example, illness), I will follow this policy and procedure as well.
